# Enhancement Checklist: Deep Learning CNN

**Priority**: IMPORTANT  
**Target Completion**: Month 1, Week 1-2  
**Status**: In Progress

## Current State Assessment
- [x] Basic implementation exists
- [x] Jupyter notebook OR Python scripts
- [ ] Production-grade code structure
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Architecture diagram
- [ ] Quantitative metrics documented
- [ ] Demo video recorded

## Critical Gaps (Must Fix for Portfolio)

### 1. Architecture Diagram
- [ ] Create high-level architecture diagram
- [ ] Show data flow with arrows
- [ ] Label all components
- [ ] Export as PNG to /docs folder
- [ ] Add diagram to README

### 2. Quantitative Metrics
- [ ] Add Results section to README
- [ ] Document performance metrics
- [ ] Add cost analysis
- [ ] Create comparison table
- [ ] Include charts if applicable

### 3. Documentation Enhancement
- [ ] Clear problem statement
- [ ] Tech stack table
- [ ] Setup instructions
- [ ] Trade-offs and Learnings section
- [ ] Link to related projects
- [ ] Add Interview Story section

### 4. Code Quality
- [ ] Refactor notebooks into modular .py files
- [ ] Add error handling and logging
- [ ] Add docstrings
- [ ] Add type hints
- [ ] Create requirements.txt
- [ ] Add .gitignore if missing

### 5. Demo and Presentation
- [ ] Record demo video (5-7 minutes)
- [ ] Upload to YouTube or Loom
- [ ] Add link to README
- [ ] Write blog post about learnings

## Enhancement Tasks by Priority

### HIGH PRIORITY (Do This Week)
1. [ ] Add architecture diagram
2. [ ] Document metrics in README
3. [ ] Add cost analysis
4. [ ] Write Trade-offs section

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Do Next Week)

6. [ ] Add error handling
7. [ ] Create setup instructions
8. [ ] Add docstrings

### LOW PRIORITY (Nice to Have)

10. [ ] Write blog post
11. [ ] Add unit tests

## Microsoft Interview Preparation

### STAR Story for This Project
**Situation**: [Context - what was the business problem]  
**Task**: [Your responsibility]  
**Action**: [What YOU did]  
**Result**: [Outcomes with metrics]

**Technical Follow-ups to Prepare**:
- [ ] How would you scale this to 10x traffic?
- [ ] What would you do differently?
- [ ] What trade-offs did you make and why?
